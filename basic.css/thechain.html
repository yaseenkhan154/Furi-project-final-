		Now first of all, I absolutely love The Chain&rsquo;s design. The mask design is absolutely amazing and he has a great imposing design fitting for a warden. Now that is out of the way, lets get on to the fight and I&rsquo;m going to be brutally honest. You have to be really bad at the game to lose to him on regular difficulty.&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;you may ask. It is because he is the tutorial boss, which means the game litterally tells you exactly how to fight him. So the only advice I can give is to pay attention and don&rsquo;t get greedy and die stupidly. That and his attack are pretty much what you would expect, he hits you with his sword and shoots you with a pistol. I will, however, talk about his story. He is the person responsible for keeping you locked up and has subjected you to shock torture the entire time.When The Voice freesyou he stands between you and your freedom, determined to stop you from leaving one way or another.
